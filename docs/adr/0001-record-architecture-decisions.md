# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2026-02-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to document the architectural decisions made for the `dbt-helpers` project to ensure consistency, provide context for future maintainers, and track the evolution of the system.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant technical choices. These records will be stored in `docs/adr` and follow a standard format including status, context, decision, and consequences.

## Consequences

- Future maintainers will have access to the reasoning behind architectural choices.
- The team can review and discuss architectural changes in a structured way.
- Requires discipline to keep ADRs updated as the project evolves.
