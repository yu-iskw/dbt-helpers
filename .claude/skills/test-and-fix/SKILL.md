# Test and Fix Loop

## Purpose

An autonomous loop for the agent to identify, analyze, and fix failing unit tests using `pytest`.

## Loop Logic

1. **Identify**: Run `make test` to identify failing tests.
2. **Analyze**: Examine the `pytest` output to determine:
   - The failing test file and line number.
   - The expected vs actual values (assertion errors).
   - Tracebacks for runtime errors.
3. **Fix**: Apply the minimum necessary change to either the source code (if it's a bug) or the test code (if the test is outdated).
4. **Verify**: Re-run `make test` (or `uv run pytest path/to/failing_test.py` for speed).
   - If passed: Move to the next failing test or finish if all are resolved.
   - If failed: Analyze the new failure and repeat the loop.

## Termination Criteria

- All tests pass (as reported by `make test`).
- Reached max iteration limit (default: 5).
- The error persists after multiple distinct fix attempts, indicating a need for human intervention.

## Examples

### Scenario: Fixing a logic error

1. `make test` fails in `tests/test_math.py` because `add(2, 2)` returned `5`.
2. Agent analyzes `src/your_package/math.py` and finds a typo `a + b + 1`.
3. Agent fixes the typo to `a + b`.
4. `make test` passes.
