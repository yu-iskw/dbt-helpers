# Clean Project (Hard Reset)

This skill provides a destructive but thorough way to repair a "broken" development environment by removing all cached artifacts and re-initializing from scratch.

## When to Use

- `uv sync` fails repeatedly with resolution errors.
- `trunk` reports internal errors that persist after `trunk install`.
- "Ghost" errors occur (failures that don't match the current code).

## Workflow

1. **Clean Project Artifacts**:

   - Run `make clean`. This script typically removes:
     - `.venv/`
     - `dist/`
     - `__pycache__/`
     - `.pytest_cache/`
     - `.mypy_cache/`
     - `.ruff_cache/`

2. **Clean Tooling Cache**:

   - Clear Trunk cache: `trunk clean`.
   - Clear uv cache: `uv cache clean`.

3. **Re-initialize Environment**:

   - Invoke the `setup-dev-env` skill to reinstall everything (e.g., `make setup`).

4. **Verify Health**:
   - Invoke the `verifier` subagent ([../../agents/verifier.md](../../agents/verifier.md)) to ensure the project is back to a clean, working state.

## Safety Note

This process is destructive to the local environment but safe for the repository. It will require a full download of all dependencies, which may take several minutes depending on network speed.
