description: Build the project and automatically fix any build errors, compilation failures, or type mismatches. Use when the project fails to build, shows "broken" states, or after making significant changes.

# Build and Fix Loop

## Purpose

An autonomous loop for the agent to identify, analyze, and fix build errors using `make build`.

## Loop Logic

1. **Identify**: Run `make build` to identify build failures.
2. **Analyze**: Examine the build output to determine:
   - The failing component (e.g., `hatch` build error).
   - The specific error message (e.g., missing dependencies, syntax errors, packaging issues).
   - Refer to [../common-references/python-commands.md](../common-references/python-commands.md) for build commands.
3. **Fix**: Apply the minimum necessary change to resolve the error (e.g., updating `pyproject.toml`, fixing syntax, or adding missing files).
4. **Verify**: Re-run `make build`.
   - If passed: Finish.
   - If failed: Analyze the new failure and repeat the loop.

## Termination Criteria

- The project builds successfully (as reported by `make build`).
- Reached max iteration limit (default: 5).
- The error persists after multiple distinct fix attempts, indicating a need for human intervention.

## Examples

### Scenario: Fixing a packaging error

1. `make build` fails because of a missing dependency in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Agent analyzes the error, adds the dependency using `uv add`.
3. `make build` now passes.
